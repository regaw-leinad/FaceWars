networking:
1) client calculates own ship & projectiles
2) client sends results up to server
3) server sends update to ALL players, including original client
4) all players draw based off server message

so?
- client event loop (requestAnimationFrame) is for calulating updated vectors
- server receives all updates and sends them out to everybody w/in game
- client draws updates whenever it receives them from server
