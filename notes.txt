networking:
1) client calculates own ship & projectiles
2) client sends results up to server
3) server sends update to ALL players, including original client
4) all players draw based off server message

so?
- client event loop (requestAnimationFrame) is for calulating updated vectors
- server receives all updates and sends them out to everybody w/in game
- client draws updates whenever it receives them from server


VECTOR PACKET
- id
- type
- x
- y
- dx
- dy
- (if CREATE) userID


game objects:
- user (userID, name, color)
- entity (x, y, dx, dy)
- size (width, height)
- playing field (radius)
- sun (vector, size)
- ship (shipID, vector, size)
- missile (missileID, vector, size)


ON GAME START
these things need to be agreed on
- game session id
- player name and colors
- player starting positions


newnew
- asteroids style, move and point separately
- square root is too heavy, avoid dx, dy
- instead!
	- store shipAngle & moveAngle
	- store x, y, speed

NEW ENTITY PACKET
- elementID (of div)
- type
- x
- y
- dx
- dy
- shipRotation
- userName (user.name is the object ID)
- visibility (T/F)
